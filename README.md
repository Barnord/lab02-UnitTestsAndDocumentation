## What is this?
This is an checkbook program, to keep track of deposits and withdrawals. You can also view your balance at any point.

## How do I use this Checkbook?
After cloning down this repo, navigate into the ATM folder, then into bin, and following down the rabbit hole until you see an ATM application.

Upon openning this application you will be greeted with a command prompt, the command prompt will ask if you would like to withdraw, deposit, or view your funds. You can then select any of them, and follow the easy to read prompts to continue to use the app. After each successive transaction you will be asked if you would like to make another transaction. If you do not, simply press enter to exit the program.

While this program works well for integers or decimals, it does not currently work well when trying to deposit or withdraw non-numerical values.
